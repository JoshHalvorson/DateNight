## About
Date Night uses the Yelp API to get random restaurants in your area and display them to you in an informative way. If you see a restaurant you like, you can save it for later, and when you're ready, view all the details again. Date Night also has the option to sign in with Blockstack, and save the restaurant's in the cloud.
